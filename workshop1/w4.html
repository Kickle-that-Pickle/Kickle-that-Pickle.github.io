      "An <a href = "https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html">education based around coding</a> would be odd, but not unworkable. <i>originate</i>
      I could see a math program being the easiest <i>to implement. courses such as</i> literature
      though, I am not <i>sure.</i> That is a subject pretty deeply rooted in
      <i>the spoken</i> and written word. Unless this is referring to  more symbolic
      use of code. <i>thats what</i> the prompt refers to as a language though.

      "Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important."
